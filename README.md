# CoinBit
Quoting the orignal developers, *"CoinBit is a beautiful CryptoCurrency app, completely open sourced and 100% in kotlin"*. The source code for the non-modified version of this application can be found [here](https://github.com/pranayairan/CoinBit).  

## Modifications

* Integration with Firebase authentication, and signup/login functionalities.
* Integration with [CryptoMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) APIs in order to arrange all lists of coins by market cap.
* Removing UI elements related to news and disclaimers in settings and main page. 
* Fixing bugs in the orignal application which led to crashes as well as the UI not behaving as it should.
